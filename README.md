# DevOps: Awareness Workshop

You're a dev, ops or qa and have little knowledge of DevOps. You want to learn more. Join us with a linux laptop for a two day workshop. You'll explore Infrastructure as Code, Continuous Delivery, Monitoring, Metrics and Diagnostics. You'll gain awareness about DevOps, knowledge in techniques and inspiration to bring ideas to your team.

## Workshop coordinates

- Target audience for this workshop are devs, ops or qa that have little or no exposure to DevOps and want to learn more. 
- There are no requirements about previous knowledge. 
- The draft presentations are on github [1] and the board is on trello [2]. 
- Participants need a laptop with linux.
- The location needs at least 30 Mbps internet speed.
- At the location, we need self-sticking flipchart paper, postits, markers, pens, paper.
- Audience size should be of 6-16.

## Assumptions about the audience

- is mostly coming from a developer background, so less knowledge of business and ops, but can also be ops or QA folks
- has mixed experience with different operating systems, windows/linux/mac, but is mainly proficient in windows
- has a spectrum of exposure to automation
- practices continuous build to some extent 
- uses (some) feedback from the build
- writes (some) unit tests
- knows about other test flavors, such as integration tests
- practices continuous integration to some extent
- is intermediate user of source control

The approach is to start from ideas, and then have practical exercises about some techniques, technologies and tools that could be applied. The scope is breadth rather than depth. 

## Main takeaways

- Awareness on DevOps motivations, goals and current status
- Awareness and possible infection with the DevOps mindset
- Knowledge about a number of techniques, technologies and tools
- Inspiration to go back to your projects and apply some of these ideas
